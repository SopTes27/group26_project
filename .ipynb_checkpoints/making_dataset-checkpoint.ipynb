    "**add the the proposal** We increased the size of the sample by combining the files we downloaded because the data is generated spontaneously. We comdined 3 data sets to get our data set that we will be working on with a sample size of 1200. We made a larger sample because it may result in higher accuracies, since our model will get to be familiar with more examples."
