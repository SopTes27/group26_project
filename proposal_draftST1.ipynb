    "The `all_exams.csv` data set is used to determine whether a student took a test prep course. Their exam scores from math, reading, and writing would identify if they attended a test prep course. The data set also contains information about high school students from the US, and includes the students’ gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, and lunch access.\n",
    "The size of the sample was increased to 1200 by combining the downloaded data, since the data is generated spontaneously. By doing this, we expect our model to have a higher accuracy because it will be able to gain familiarity with more data examples.\n"
